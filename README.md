ü•≥ On GameChanger Wallet we are happy to announce the first third party language integrated on our DSL: The Helios Smart Contract Language, a very powerfull and easy to understand DSL to code Plutus validators on Cardano created by Christian Schmitz. To celebrate and share for the first time the big picture behind our design principles, I've coded an educational dapp based on one of the Helios examples:

## ‚è∞ Helios Timelock

An Owner user makes a deposit on the contract. Only the Owner or a Beneficiary at the right time can withdraw the funds. But there's a catch I won't reveal this early... First try it by yourself. Is Cardano Preproduction Testnet. On GameChanger Wallet if you wait some seconds, an airdrop is presented to you to fund your empty wallets. Or use Cardano Faucet

## Device Support: 

- Mobile
- Desktop
- Offline/Remote (our dapp connector wallet-agnostic links are reusable accross wallets and devices)

## Features:
- fully client side, in user hands as it should be
- on-the-fly **Helios** smart contract code compilation
- no backends, only Cardano-GraphQL hosted on Dandelion APIs
- privacy preserving dapp connections
- UTXO management non delegated to dapps (terrible thing to do Cardano!)
- open interoperable protocol interface
- on-chain + off-chain code stored on-chain
- fully auditable in human-readable languages **GCScript** (JSON) and **Helios**
- disaster recovery
- censorship resistant
- perpetual application
- vanilla javascript + JSON + Helios, no other language required nor low level Cardano libraries
- open source code 
- open public deployment
